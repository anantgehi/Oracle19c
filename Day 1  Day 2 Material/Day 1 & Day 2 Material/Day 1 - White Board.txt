Topic 1: Introduction to RDBMS & Database:

Databases which are based on RDBMS differ on:
1) Architecture
2) Volume of data getting stored & handled
3) Concurrent user support 
4) User Creation & Privileges Management
5) Date Functions
**6) Programmability features (PL/SQL) & Syntax
7) Transaction Management features
8) Indexes
9) Tuning of Databases
10) Proprietory SQL Syntax and features

Common Features of Database which are based on RDBMS:
1) RDBMS Concepts or Framework -- PK, FK, UK, NN, Check Constraint
2) ANSI SQL Syntax and features
3) Basic concepts of Database Programmability (not syntax)

Objectives of Any RDBMS Database:
1) Storage -- Physical & Logical
*****2) Retrieval -- SQL Select
3) Permissions on Data

Physical & Logical Storage?

Example: Customer is the table. This is the Logical Layer.
Every Database Table is Mapped to a physical file stored in the hard disk.

In Oracle Employee is the table created by Oracle user Scott.
There is a .dbf file stored in the C:\Ora_Home\Data\Main123.dbf

Employee Table's data resides in the Main123.dbf file.

Main123.dbf file is the Physical Layer.

Initially Main123.dbf was having 50 GB space.
Auto Increase can be made ON  for the file. 25%, 35%

Traditionally Scott is the Non DBA user with password tiger
