When to use Inline Views or Derived Tables:

****1) When a expression or formula is getting used in other expressions or formulae.

****2) When we want to filter records as per the Expression column's alias.

*****3) When there is an complex expression as a Non Aggregate column along with Aggregate column then instead of putting that same complex expression in Group By clause we can use Inline Views or Derived Tables.

*******4) When we have groupable, non groupable, aggregate and expressions columns all together in column list to show summary values along with actual values then create a Inline View or Derived Table which has the "Summary Output". Join it with regular table and filter it if required!

**********5) To perform "Top N Analysis" (OP)
