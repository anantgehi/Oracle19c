Arrays in PLSQL:

Arrays in PLSQL are termed as "PLSQL Tables" or also known as "Associate Arrays".


--------------------------------------


Triggers:

Trigger is a piece of code (like a procedure) which will "implicitly" get executed when any DML / DDL / DCL event occurs.
Select is NOT an event for trigger to get executed.


Procedure cannot be "implicitly" executed.
Either the procedure has to be "explicitly" called or it has to be "scheduled".


Triggers can niether be "explicitly" called nor can be "scheduled".

Benefits of Triggers Or Why Triggers:
1) To transfer newly inserted rows in the main to another table.
2) To take an "programmatic" backup of deleted rows and old values before update.
3) To perform "complex validations" before inserting records which are NOT possible through Check constraints or by PKs.
4) To set an "programmatic" audit, by which the DML / DDL events can be kept track of.
5) To provide conditional Access (Insert / Update / Delete) to users based on Date, Day, Time, User basis.
6) To perform DML on a view which is based on join condition.

Types of Triggers:
1) Based on Timing:
	a) Before DML  -- For validation purpose
	b) After DML   -- For performing other activities like backup, etc.
	c) Instead of DML -- For Views Only

2) Based on Execution:
	a) Row Level -- Code gets executed once for every row.
	b) Statement Level aka Table Level (Default) -- Code gets executed "ONLY ONCE" for that statement, not depending on number of rows affected.

Procedure can be called in 2 ways inside Trigger:

1) In Bodyless Trigger Mention Call Procedure and do not mention ;

OR

2) Inside the Trigger Body
